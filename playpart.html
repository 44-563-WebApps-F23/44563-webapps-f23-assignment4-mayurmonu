        <p>MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
            equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
            on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
            you coming too, Oswald?<br>
            
            OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.<br>
            
            MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
            shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!<br>
            
            REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?<br>
            
            MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.<br>
            
            REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.<br>
            
            [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]<br>
            
            MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
